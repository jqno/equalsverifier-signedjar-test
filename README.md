# EqualsVerifier-signedjar-test

This project generates a single abstract class inside a signed jar, which can be used in [EqualsVerifier](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/) to test that it properly handles signed jars.

Thanks to [sywor](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/163) for helping me set up this project.
